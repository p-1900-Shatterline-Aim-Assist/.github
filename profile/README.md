## 🎮 What Is Shatterline Aim Assist?

**Aim assist** in Shatterline cheats is a light version of aimbot — it gently pulls your crosshair toward the enemy, helps track movement, and stabilizes aim under pressure. It’s not aggressive, doesn’t snap, and mimics legit hand-controlled tracking.

You’re still in control — but the assist makes your aim stick like glue. 🎯
